Atomic commits are going to be an essential skill to learn.

Also, this project is helping see how I really need to nail the functions and features of a thing before I start "finalizing" the visuals. Even if everything is going to work out fine, there is still quite a lot of concern in my mind regarding what happens when I need to restructure some HTML. Outlining that HTML and getting everything wired up correctly before adding some CSS is going to help me a ton in the future.

This is a learning experience so I'm not going to get all bent out of shape. I'm still uncovering assumptions (like, what happens when there are two submit buttons on a form page?). I think one of the most valuable things that these projects are teaching me is to learn how to think through a problem. They are teaching me all the different parts that I need to consider when designing code. This is hugely important. 

Essentially, these projects are uncovering my unknown unknowns.
