# a sign up form
just some practice creating a form

## TODO
research: how to implement two form submits on one page

fix: change checkboxes to radio (only one being selectable at a time)

feat: form validations (no js)
- name
- email
- message
- newsletter sign up
- error messages
- helper text (opt)

style: focus and hover effects

## What I did
Used HTML and CSS to build a simple web form that simulates sending a message (like on a contact page) and signing up for a newsletter.

## What I learned
1. Atomic commits are an essential skill
2. Prioritize building a complete HTML structure before styling things
3. This is all a process of uncovering my unknown unknowns (as well as solidifying my knowns)

Atomic commits are going to be an essential skill to learn.

Also, this project is helping see how I really need to nail the functions and features of a thing before I start "finalizing" the visuals. Even if everything is going to work out fine, there is still quite a lot of concern in my mind regarding what happens when I need to restructure some HTML. Outlining that HTML and getting everything wired up correctly before adding some CSS is going to help me a ton in the future.

This is a learning experience so I'm not going to get all bent out of shape. I'm still uncovering assumptions (like, what happens when there are two submit buttons on a form page?). I think one of the most valuable things that these projects are teaching me is to learn how to think through a problem. They are teaching me all the different parts that I need to consider when designing code. This is hugely important. 

Essentially, these projects are uncovering my unknown unknowns.
